This code is designed to pull all of the GALEX tiles for a given galaxy from the galbase at OSU, mosaic those files to create a single image, quantify the noise in that image, and generate a cutout FITS file.

The two pieces that do that are:
make_cutouts.py -- takes in command line options, gathers data for each galaxy from galbase to feed name, ra, and dec into extract_stamp.
extract_stamp.py -- Given a galaxy name, ra, dec, and other options, it pulls all of the GALEX tiles in an overlap region around the galaxy, stitches them together, and outputs a FITS postage stamp.

Other requirements:
Montage
Python montage_wrapper
